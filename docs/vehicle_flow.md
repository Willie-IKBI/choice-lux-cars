1. Purpose
Enable Admins and Managers to manage the fleet of vehicles used by the company, including adding new vehicles, viewing all existing vehicles, updating details like license expiry, and tracking vehicle status and documentation such as the registration date and fuel type.

üìå License Expiry Validation Logic
‚úÖ Valid = Expiry is more than 3 months from today

‚ùå Expired = Expiry is in the past

This is visually reflected using badges (green, orange, red) beside the expiry date.
