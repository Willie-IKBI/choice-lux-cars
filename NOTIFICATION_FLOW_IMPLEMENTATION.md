## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Create Test Notification**:
   - Navigate to Notifications screen
   - Tap the "+" button (test button)
   - Verify notification appears with "New job assigned - Job #TEST-001"
   - Verify bell icon shows badge count

2. **Test Navigation**:
   - Tap on the notification
   - Should navigate to job summary screen
   - Verify "Confirm Job" button is visible

3. **Test Confirmation**:
   - Click "Confirm Job" button
   - Verify notification disappears from unread count
   - Verify bell badge count decreases

### Database Testing
- The migration file is ready to be applied
- Triggers will automatically create notifications for new job assignments
- Job confirmation will automatically mark notifications as read

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### To Deploy the System:
1. **Apply Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   # When Docker is available
   supabase db reset
   
   # Or apply to remote database
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Test with Real Jobs**:
   - Create a job with a driver assigned
   - Verify notification appears for the driver
   - Test the complete flow

3. **Monitor and Optimize**:
   - Monitor notification delivery
   - Check real-time performance
   - Optimize if needed
