# Storage Bucket Fix - Resolved

## **Problem Identified:**
The error "Bucket not found" occurred because the code was trying to upload to a bucket called `'odometer'`, but your Supabase storage structure uses a bucket called `'clc_images'` with an `'odometer'` folder inside it.

## **Root Cause:**
- **Code Expected**: Bucket name `'odometer'`
- **Actual Structure**: Bucket name `'clc_images'` with folder `'odometer'`
- **Result**: 404 "Bucket not found" error

## **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Updated Upload Service (`lib/core/services/upload_service.dart`)**
- **Modified Methods**: Updated `uploadImage()` and `uploadImageBytes()` to accept folder parameter
- **Added Convenience Methods**:
  - `uploadOdometerImage()` - Uploads to `clc_images/odometer/`
  - `uploadVehicleImage()` - Uploads to `clc_images/vehicles/`
  - `uploadProfileImage()` - Uploads to `clc_images/profile_images/`
- **Path Structure**: Now uses `bucket/folder/filename` format

### **2. Updated Vehicle Return Modal**
- **Changed From**: `UploadService.uploadImageBytes(bytes, 'odometer', filename)`
- **Changed To**: `UploadService.uploadOdometerImage(bytes, filename)`

### **3. Updated Vehicle Collection Modal**
- **Changed From**: `UploadService.uploadImageBytes(bytes, 'clc_images', 'odometer/filename')`
- **Changed To**: `UploadService.uploadOdometerImage(bytes, filename)`

## **Your Supabase Storage Structure:**
```
clc_images (bucket)
├── odometer/          ← Odometer images go here
├── vehicles/          ← Vehicle images
├── profile_images/    ← Profile images
├── app_images/
├── company_logo/
├── driver_lic/
├── pdp_lic/
├── profiles/
├── slips/
├── traffic_images/
└── logos/
```

## **Next Steps:**

### **1. Run Storage Policies Script**
Execute this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase_storage_policies.sql
```

### **2. Test the Fix**
1. Run the app: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Try to return a vehicle with an odometer image
3. The image should now upload successfully to `clc_images/odometer/`

## **What the Fix Does:**

### **Before (Broken):**
```dart
// Tried to upload to non-existent 'odometer' bucket
await UploadService.uploadImageBytes(
  bytes,
  'odometer',  // ❌ This bucket doesn't exist
  filename
);
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```dart
// Uploads to existing 'clc_images' bucket in 'odometer' folder
await UploadService.uploadOdometerImage(
  bytes,
  filename
);
// Results in: clc_images/odometer/filename.jpg
```

## **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Uses Existing Structure**: Works with your current Supabase storage setup
- ✅ **Organized Folders**: Images are properly organized by type
- ✅ **Convenience Methods**: Easy-to-use methods for different image types
- ✅ **Consistent Naming**: Follows your existing naming conventions
- ✅ **No New Buckets**: Uses existing `clc_images` bucket

## **Expected Result:**
- **No more "Bucket not found" errors**
- **Images upload successfully to the correct folders**
- **Vehicle return process works without issues**

The storage bucket issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
